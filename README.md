# Project 3: Around The U.S.

**Intro**

Hello, for Project 3: Around The U.S I would be discussion of how I use 4 resources to give explantion how I used BEM, what layout is used, the importance of Normalize.css, Why do we used specific fonts, and using flex box and gird.

### Tools For This Project

- HTML
- CSS
- Figma
- Devtool

**Figma**

Figma is a source to view how the layout should be implemented to connect in VSCode, such as, color, fonts, line height, gap, padding, margin, fonts text, grid or flexbox, and understanding which different devices is to use for media queries.

**BEM**

BEM stands for Block elements and modifying which play a tremendous role for HTML and Css.
For example, Block would be .card, element would be .card** image, and to specify modifying we would need to have to used elements such as .card**title, .card**description, and card**button to adjust project card with HTML and CSS.

- Key data to know is Block on HTML

<--! header class="header">
<--! img class="logo" />
<--! form class="search-form">< /form>
<--! ul class="menu"> /ul>
/header>

**Normalize.css**

By creating a pages block of index.css, we can see normalize.css is on the first @import url.

- @import url("../vendor/normalize.css");
  @import url("../vendor/fonts.css");
  @import url("../blocks/page.css");
  @import url("../blocks/header.css");
  @import url("../blocks/footer.css");
  @import url("../blocks/profile.css");
  @import url("../blocks/cards.css");
  @import url("../blocks/card.css");

- Normalize.css helps Preserving useful defaults while collecting common bugs, reducing likelihood of unexpected issues across different browsers and devices, moreover; normalize.css help to optimize page load time.

**Fonts**

The reason why we use fonts is not all users have the same fonts installed on the devices, another thing is alternative fonts provide a backup plan, allowing your content to remain readable and accessible even if they prefer fonts that are not available.
